# Reproducibility demo

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of this repository (project_01) is to make of small example on how to make a project reproducible.

In order to reproduce what I'm about to show, you can download the repository by clicking on the green "< > Code" button,
at the top of the file list, then click on "Download ZIP" to save the whole project_01 somewhere on your computer.

For the demo we will use the penguins dataset from the R package [palmerpenguins](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/)
